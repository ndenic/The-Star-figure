# The-Star-figure
### Code Challenge — Write a program
Given an odd number n, not exceeding 15. Create a two-dimensional array (matrix) from n×n elements, by filling it with "." symbols (each element of the matrix is a string containing a single symbol). 
Then fill the middle row of the matrix, the middle column, and the main and the secondary diagonals with the "*" symbols. 
As a result, all "*"s in the array must form the star figure. 
Output this matrix; elements of the array should be space separated.
